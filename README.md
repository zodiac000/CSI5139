# CSI5139

This repository is an implementation of the paper "Multi-Scale Residual Network Image-Resolution Applied to Image Classification".

## Prerequisites:
* Python 3.6
* PyTorch >= 0.4.0
* numpy
* matplotlib
* tqdm

## Dataset
- Training for MSRN:
	DIV2K: Contains 800 high-resolution training images with the size of 2040 x 1356.

- Testing for MSRN: 
	IMAGENET: Contains 5500 high-resolution images with variant sizes from Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2017(ILSVRC2017).

- Training and testing for classification:
 	Kaggle: Contains 4242 high-resolution labeled images of five different kind of flowers. The dataset has been divided into 80\% for training and 20\% for testing.
